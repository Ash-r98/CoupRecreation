# Information

This game was initially developed in about 5 hours while I was very ill and editing a short film at the same time. I also basically did not test this, so if you find any bugs feel free to insult me and hire assassins to murder me

# Future additions

- Inquisitor option
- Teams option
- Experimental custom rules:
  - An option to block your team being switched for 1 coins
  - A balance adjustment to Inquisitors, removing their ability to block Captain
  - A new card: The Diplomat
